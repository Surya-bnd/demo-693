* Branches can be only created form the existing branch
* By default a master/main branch is created if you run the bellow command a new banch will will be created
```
git branch f1
```
* when we work on real time senirios we have many multiple branches how do we determine which branch are we on currently?
    that is where HEAD comes in picture
* You can switch branches using either of these commands
```
git switch <name of the branch>
```
or
```
git checkout <name of the branch>
```
